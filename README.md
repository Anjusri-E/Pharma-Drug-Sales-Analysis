## Project Overview üéØ

This project involves an end-to-end analysis of pharmaceutical drug sales data, transforming raw sales transactions into a comprehensive and interactive Power BI dashboard. The goal is to provide stakeholders with meaningful insights into sales performance, market dynamics, and key metrics. The dashboard visualizes data collected from 2014 to 2019, with a focus on trends by product, region, and various timeframes.

## Data & Technology üõ†Ô∏è

* **Data Cleaning & Preparation:** Utilized **Excel** and **Power Query** to handle raw data, ensuring accuracy and consistency.
* **Data Modeling & Analysis:** Performed in-depth data analysis and created custom metrics using **DAX** (Data Analysis Expressions) to model relationships and provide deeper insights.
* **Tool:** Microsoft Power BI was used for all data transformation, modeling, and visualization.
* **Dataset:** Sales data for 57 drugs, categorized into 8 different groups based on the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) Classification System.
* **Timeframes:** Analysis of sales data on a weekly, monthly, hourly, and yearly basis.

## Key Features & Visualizations ‚ú®

The dashboard provides a robust view of sales performance through the following components:

* **Sales Trend Analysis:** Visualizations showing sales trends over different time periods (weekly, monthly, yearly) to identify peak seasons and patterns.
* **Market & Product Performance:** Charts and tables that break down sales by drug category and individual product to highlight top-performing drugs.
* **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):** At-a-glance metrics for total sales, average monthly sales, and highest count of drug sold per hour.
* **Geographical Analysis:** A breakdown of sales by region to understand geographical market dynamics.
* **Interactive Slicers:** Dynamic filters for date, region, and product to allow for custom, on-demand analysis.

## What I Learned üí°

* **End-to-End Data Pipeline:** Managed the entire analytics lifecycle from raw data acquisition to final dashboard delivery.
* **Data Transformation:** Gained hands-on experience in cleaning and organizing complex data for effective analysis.
* **Advanced BI Skills:** Built dynamic and interactive reports with Power BI, leveraging DAX for complex calculations and insights.
